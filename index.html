        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <h3>What mods can I get from this website?</h3>
        <p>
            You can download the official lstwoMODS alongside other mods I, or other people have made that have been added here.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I change the player limit from 4 in Wobbly Life using lstwoMODS?</h3>
        <p>
            No, get <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wobblylife/mods/8">Larger Lobbies</a> for that.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Why did you get rid of the installer app?</h3>
        <p>
            It's easier for me to program UI for an installer in HTML than WPF and the installer was just kind of unnecessary bloat to be installing.
            Also it's probably quicker to get the mods by downloading them from a website than having to install an app that gets blocked every 2 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Wobbly Life installer arcade mod has been unlisted as it was broken for a lot of people and could have been made a lot better.
        </p>

        <h3>Can my save file be corrupted through these mods?</h3>
        <p>
            For lstwoMODS the save file should only be changed when doing things that the game saves to the save file like progressing a mission or giving yourself money. lstwoMODS itself won't change the save file by itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for save file corruptions that has never been reported yet as lstwoMODS uses in game functions instead of changing the save file manually.
        </p>
        <p>
            This information is for lstwoMODS though, other mods may do things differently so make sure to check their descriptions / READMEs for any warnings.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I get these on the PC XBOX version of this game?</h3>
        <p>
            You probably can as I heard some people having success with that, though this is not officially supported so you are on your own and mod support for this version may vary.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I install this on linux?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, but you probably have to use manual installation. You can find these for lstwoMODS <a href="https://github.com/lstwomods">here</a>! 
            Other mods will probably require you to place the dll files into the BepInEx/plugins folder or if they have .zip files that are already laid out just put them at the correct location in the games folder.
            To make sure always check the mods' README.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also note that games running under proton (like Wobbly Life) require you to use the Windows (probably x64) version of BepInEx.
        </p>
        <p>
            Btw if you are on linux and would like to make this website's installer work on linux feel free to add .sh versions of my .bat scripts for installing.
        </p>
